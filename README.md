# Code-Samples
Hello there! 

Here you'll find a collection of classes from my work on Knight Crawlers and Battle Showdown.
It includes some of the classes that best showcase my work without giving away too much source code as the games are commercially available.

Below you will find links to games I had worked on in varying capacities ranging from community management, game design, and sound design.
With most games I was part of the team from ideation all the way to release and taking part in post-launch maintenance and updates.
